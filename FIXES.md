# Trello-lite Issue Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Team Data Fetching Issue

**Problem**: "Failed to fetch team data. Please try again." error when trying to access teams in the dashboard.

**Root Causes**:
- Backend team service wasn't including necessary relationship data
- Frontend error handling was too generic
- Missing proper TypeScript types for backend responses

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Backend Changes (`backend/src/services/team.service.ts`):
- Enhanced `getTeamsByUserId` to include project and member counts using Prisma's `_count`
- Enhanced `getTeamById` to include related projects and counts
- Better data structure returned from backend

#### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/services/team.service.ts`):
- Improved error handling with specific error messages
- Added fallback logic for missing `_count` data
- Better error propagation to UI components

#### API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`):
- Added response interceptor for 401 errors (token expiration)
- Automatic logout when token is invalid
- Better error handling throughout the application

### 2. TypeScript Type Issues

**Problem**: Inconsistent types between frontend and backend, potential type errors in LandingPage.tsx

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Types Update (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`):
- Enhanced Team interface to match backend response structure
- Added optional fields for backend-provided data
- Better type safety throughout the application

#### LandingPage.tsx Improvements:
- Integrated with AuthContext properly (was bypassing it before)
- Used proper login/logout methods from context
- Better TypeScript type safety

#### DashboardPage.tsx Improvements:
- Used AuthContext logout method instead of direct localStorage manipulation
- Consistent authentication handling

### 3. Authentication Flow Improvements

**Problem**: Inconsistent authentication handling across components

**Fixes Applied**:
- LandingPage now uses AuthContext.login method
- DashboardPage uses AuthContext.logout method  
- Automatic token validation and cleanup on 401 errors
- Centralized authentication state management

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install  # If dependencies aren't installed
npm run dev  # This should start the server on port 8000
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # If dependencies aren't installed
npm run dev  # This should start on port 5173
```

### 3. Test the Connection
```bash
# Run this from the root directory
node test-connection.js
```

### 4. Test User Flow
1. Navigate to the frontend (usually http://localhost:5173)
2. Register a new account or use the "Quick Demo Login" button
3. Try creating a team in the dashboard
4. Navigate to the team page to create projects

## Potential Remaining Issues

### Database Connection
If you're still getting the "Failed to fetch team data" error, it might be due to:

1. **Database not running**: Make sure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
2. **Environment variables**: Check that `.env` file has correct database URL
3. **Prisma migrations**: Run `npx prisma migrate dev` in the backend directory
4. **Database seeding**: You might need initial data

### Backend Server Issues
If the backend won't start:

1. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the backend directory
2. **TypeScript compilation**: The `tsx` package should handle this automatically
3. **Port conflicts**: Make sure port 8000 is available

### Quick Database Setup (if using Docker)
```bash
# From the root directory
docker-compose up -d

# Then in the backend directory
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

## Summary of Changes Made

✅ **Backend team service**: Enhanced with proper relationship data and counts
✅ **Frontend team service**: Better error handling and fallback logic  
✅ **API interceptors**: Automatic token validation and cleanup
✅ **TypeScript types**: Consistent types across frontend and backend
✅ **Authentication flow**: Proper AuthContext usage throughout the app
✅ **Error handling**: More specific error messages and better UX

The main issue was that the backend wasn't providing the complete data structure that the frontend expected, and there wasn't proper error handling to debug the issue. These fixes should resolve both the team data fetching problem and improve the overall robustness of the application.
